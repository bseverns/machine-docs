# Preview Capture Cheat Sheet

Open the project in MakerBot Print 4.12.1, enable the chamber preview, and flip to the layer view that shows both extruders firing. Export a screenshot once the RapidRinse supports look clean.

Save it in this folder as `preview.png`. Keep the screenshot wide enough to show the ABS-R profile summary on the right so anyone can confirm 240 °C / 110 °C without launching the app.

If you're running remote and can't grab it, jot a note in the sample run log and leave this placeholder in place for the next shift.
