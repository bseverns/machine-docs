# Sample Job — ABS-R Dual-Extrusion Cube

Rock the Method X with a 20 mm cube that exercises both extruders and RapidRinse. Load it in **MakerBot Print 4.12.1** using the included profile before you even think about pushing someone else's CAD.

## Files
- `calibration-cube-20mm.stl` — watertight cube, drop it straight into MakerBot Print.
- `makerbot-print-4.12.1-method-x-standard.json` — tuned for ABS-R model material with RapidRinse supports.
- `preview-notes.md` — guide for snagging the layer preview screenshot when you're at the console.

## Material + Tooling
- **Model Extruder:** Smart Extruder X with ABS-R at 255 °C.
- **Support Extruder:** RapidRinse spool at 240 °C.
- **Build Plate:** Polypropylene base, scrubbed, 95 °C bed with chamber at 60 °C.

## Expectations
- Watch the first two raft layers; if they look stringy, pause and re-level.
- RapidRinse purge should land cleanly in the front chute. Missed? File an incident.
- Let the part soak in warm water for 10 minutes post-print to verify the dissolving action.
