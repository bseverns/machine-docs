# MakerBot Method X

_Aim: reliable, repeatable results with clear guardrails._

## Start here
- [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) — get oriented and run a controlled first print.
- [Safety](./safety.md) — ventilation, PPE, and emergency stops for this enclosed system.
- [SOP](./sop.md) — canonical checklist from preflight through shutdown.

## Keep the trail warm
- [Maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv) — capture chamber temp tweaks, offsets, and consumables.
- [Incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) — log jams, purge issues, or enclosure alarms within 24 hours.
- [Profiles](./profiles/) — Method X slicer profiles; version them by material + support strategy.
- [Checklists](./checklists/) — training aides and run cards.
- [Training assets](./training/) — quizzes, videos, and QR resources.

## Field notes
- Treat ABS/ASA jobs with proper ventilation and schedule them when the lab can handle fumes.
- Document soluble support usage and disposal steps in the [materials](./materials.md) file.
- Keep [calibration](./calibration.md) data current; the enclosed environment can drift with chamber heat.
