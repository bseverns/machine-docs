# MakerBot Method X

_Aim: reliable, repeatable results with clear guardrails._

- Start with `quickstart.md` and `sop.md`.
- Keep `logs/maintenance-log.csv` up to date.
- Profiles live in `profiles/` and should be **versioned** and labeled by slicer.

## Notes
- Enclosed printer; treat ABS/ASA jobs with ventilation protocols.
- Note soluble supports if used; dispose per policy.
