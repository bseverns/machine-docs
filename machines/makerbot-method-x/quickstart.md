# Quick Start — MakerBot Method X

**Goal:** Produce a clean, enclosed-chamber print in ~15 minutes while respecting fumes and supports.

1. Study the [safety brief](./safety.md); confirm ventilation and purge paths are active.
2. Load the **sample job** from [`profiles/sample`](./profiles/sample/) and verify the chamber + material settings match the cartridge installed.
3. Execute the [SOP](./sop.md) in order: Preflight → Operation → Postflight — no skipping warmups.
4. Log temperature offsets, purge strips, or material swaps in the [maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv).
5. Capture jams, enclosure alarms, or anomalies in the [incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) so we can troubleshoot fast.
