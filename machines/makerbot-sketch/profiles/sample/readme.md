# Sample Job — Sketch PLA Check Cube

Teachers and techs alike: this 20 mm PLA cube is the baseline for classroom success. Spin it up in **MakerBot Print 4.12.1** with the included Sketch profile to make sure kids inherit a dialed-in machine.

## Files
- `calibration-cube-20mm.stl` — ready-to-slice geometry, 100% manifold.
- `makerbot-print-4.12.1-sketch-standard.json` — gentle PLA recipe with 15% triangles so cooldown is fast.
- `preview-notes.md` — how to capture and stash the screenshot once you've got a minute.

## Material + Tooling
- **Filament:** MakerBot Tough PLA (or equivalent PLA) at 205 °C.
- **Extruder:** Standard 0.4 mm Smart Extruder.
- **Build Plate:** Flex plate with build tape. Swap the tape if it's crusty.

## Expectations
- Print time: ~35 minutes.
- Don't disable the brim. It keeps student builds from going feral.
- Record any elephant-foot bigger than 0.3 mm so we can tweak Z-offset before the next class.
