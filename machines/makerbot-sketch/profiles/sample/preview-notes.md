# Preview Capture Cheat Sheet

Still need the glam shot. Open the `.makerbot` project with this profile loaded, spin the viewport to show the brim, layer lines, and support-free interior, then punch `File → Export Screenshot`.

Save the resulting PNG as `preview.png` right next to this note. Keep the frame tight on the build plate and include the settings drawer on the right so future teachers can eyeball the 205 °C / 60 °C defaults at a glance.

When you've got it, delete this note or move it into the lab log. Until then, treat this as the promise of a picture.
