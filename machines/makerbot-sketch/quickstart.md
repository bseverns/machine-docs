# Quick Start — MakerBot Sketch

**Goal:** Get your first clean print in ~15 minutes without sacrificing safety or the machine.

1. Read the local [safety brief](./safety.md) and point out the E-stop to a buddy.
2. Load the provided **sample job** from [`profiles/sample`](./profiles/sample/) and confirm the slicer matches the lab station.
3. Follow the [SOP](./sop.md) step-by-step: Preflight → Operation → Postflight.
4. If you touched hardware, swapped filament, or noticed a quirk, log it in the [maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv).
5. Anything unexpected? Capture it in the [incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) so the next crew can react fast.
