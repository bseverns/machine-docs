# MakerBot Sketch

_Aim: reliable, repeatable results with clear guardrails._

## Start here
- [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) — get a successful print out in about 15 minutes.
- [Safety](./safety.md) — hazards, PPE, and how to slam the E-stop without flinching.
- [SOP](./sop.md) — the canonical preflight → run → postflight flow.

## Keep the trail warm
- [Maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv) — record tweaks, swaps, or weird noises.
- [Incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) — document anything sketchy within 24 hours.
- [Profiles](./profiles/) — slicer configs; version them by slicer + material combo.
- [Checklists](./checklists/) — printable aides for training or checkout.
- [Training assets](./training/) — quizzes, slide decks, or QR codes.

## Field notes
- Runs MakerBot cloud or desktop slicers depending on the lab station; confirm before you slice.
- Double-check filament diameter and units (mm) in any imported profile before pressing go.
- Keep [materials](./materials.md) and [calibration](./calibration.md) docs updated as the machine drifts.
