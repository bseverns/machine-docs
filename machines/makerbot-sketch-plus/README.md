# MakerBot Sketch+

_Aim: reliable, repeatable results with clear guardrails._

## Start here
- [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) — land a quality print fast while learning the flow.
- [Safety](./safety.md) — hazards, ventilation cues, and the E-stop drill.
- [SOP](./sop.md) — authoritative checklist for preflight → run → postflight.

## Keep the trail warm
- [Maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv) — record tune-ups, offsets, or consumable swaps.
- [Incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) — log misfires or material issues inside 24 hours.
- [Profiles](./profiles/) — slicer configs; tag versions by slicer + nozzle combo.
- [Checklists](./checklists/) — laminated aides for students and mentors.
- [Training assets](./training/) — quizzes, slides, and QR-ready references.

## Field notes
- Shares workflow DNA with the Sketch, but keep profiles separate to respect build volume differences.
- Document nozzle swaps or alternate build surfaces directly in the [materials](./materials.md) and [calibration](./calibration.md) notes.
