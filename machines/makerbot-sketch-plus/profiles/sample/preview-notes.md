# Preview Capture Cheat Sheet

Need proof that the dual nozzles are in sync? Open the project in MakerBot Print 4.12.1 with the included profile, switch to Layer View so both colors are obvious, and export a screenshot.

Drop the PNG in this folder as `preview.png`. Frame the build plate, the color legend, and the right-hand settings drawer (fans and chamber temp) so another instructor can see the offsets at a glance.

No time right now? Cool. Leave this note as a marker and log the missing image in the run log so we know to snag it later.
