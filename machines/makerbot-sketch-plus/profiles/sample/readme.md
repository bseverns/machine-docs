# Sample Job — Sketch+ Dual PLA+ Cube

The Sketch+ wants dual-extrusion love too. Load the included files in **MakerBot Print 4.12.1** to confirm PLA+ flow and the support nozzle offset before students print their capstones.

## Files
- `calibration-cube-20mm.stl` — dimensionally honest cube for quick verification.
- `makerbot-print-4.12.1-sketch-plus-standard.json` — PLA+ tuned profile with gyroid infill and light supports.
- `preview-notes.md` — checklist for capturing the dual-color preview when you have cycles.

## Material + Tooling
- **Model Extruder:** PLA+ at 210 °C (white spool).
- **Support Extruder:** Same PLA+ at 205 °C (contrast color for visibility).
- **Build Plate:** Flex plate at 60 °C with fresh glue stick layer.

## Expectations
- Total build: ~32 minutes with 22% infill.
- Keep supports enabled — they prove the second extruder is alive.
- If the purge walls fuse, record it so we can recalibrate alignment.
