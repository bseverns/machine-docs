# Quick Start — MakerBot Sketch+

**Goal:** Ship a trustworthy print in ~15 minutes while learning the lab-specific quirks.

1. Review the [safety brief](./safety.md) and confirm ventilation is on point for the material.
2. Bring `calibration-cube-20mm.stl` into MakerBot Print with `makerbot-print-4.12.1-sketch-plus-standard.json` from [`profiles/sample`](./profiles/sample/) to exercise both extruders.
3. March through the [SOP](./sop.md): Preflight → Operation → Postflight without skipping checkboxes.
4. Capture the print in the [sample run log](./logs/sample-run-log.csv) — include which color ran supports and whether purge walls behaved.
5. Log any offsets, swaps, or tweaks in the [maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv) before you walk away.
6. If anything went sideways, drop a note in the [incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) so the crew can debrief.
