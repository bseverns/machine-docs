# LulzBot Mini 3

_Aim: reliable, repeatable results with clear guardrails._

## Start here
- [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) — dial in your first print with Cura and lab checks.
- [Safety](./safety.md) — hazards, hot surfaces, and emergency stops.
- [SOP](./sop.md) — the definitive runbook from preflight to shutdown.

## Keep the trail warm
- [Maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv) — note nozzle wipes, offsets, or bed swaps.
- [Incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) — record jams or anomalies within 24 hours.
- [Profiles](./profiles/) — Cura profiles; version them by material and layer height.
- [Checklists](./checklists/) — training aides and certification forms.
- [Training assets](./training/) — quizzes, demos, and QR codes.

## Field notes
- Use Cura (LulzBot Edition or vanilla Cura) profiles from the [profiles](./profiles/) folder; keep lab-specific adjustments documented.
- Track Z-offset per build surface in the [calibration](./calibration.md) doc.
- Update the [materials](./materials.md) list when adding filaments or changing temperature ranges.
