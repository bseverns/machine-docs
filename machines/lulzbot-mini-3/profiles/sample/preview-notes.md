# Preview Capture Cheat Sheet

Cura LulzBot Edition 5.6.0 can export a screenshot straight from Layer View. Load the `cura` profile, set the preview to 0.2 mm layers, and show the travel moves so we can catch any retraction weirdness.

Export the screenshot and save it here as `preview.png`. Keep the window wide enough to show the profile summary card and the toolhead temperature block.

If you're working from home, leave this note and add a TODO in the sample run log so the next in-shop tech grabs the image.
