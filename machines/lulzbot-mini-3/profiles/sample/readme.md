# Sample Job — 20 mm Cube Sanity Check

Welcome to the house cube. Slice it in **Cura LulzBot Edition 5.6.0** using the bundled `cura-5.6.0-lulzbot-mini-3-standard.curaprofile` and you're living that factory baseline dream.

## Files
- `calibration-cube-20mm.stl` — simple geometry so the printer can prove it still knows which way is up.
- `cura-5.6.0-lulzbot-mini-3-standard.curaprofile` — standard PLA recipe for the Mini 3, 0.2 mm layers, 20% grid infill.
- `preview-notes.md` — capture instructions so we eventually land the Cura screenshot.

## Material + Tooling
- **Filament:** Generic PLA in LulzBot green (or any 2.85 mm PLA that isn't brittle).
- **Nozzle:** 0.4 mm brass hot end, wiped and tightened to spec.
- **Bed:** PEI sheet scrubbed with IPA, 60 °C setpoint.

## Expectations
- Total runtime: ~25 minutes.
- Use a 5 mm brim as exported; peel after cooldown to save your fingernails.
- Measure the cube. If X/Y deviate more than ±0.2 mm, drop a note in the calibration tracker.

> 📸 Screenshot TBD — once you follow `preview-notes.md`, drop the exported Cura view here as `preview.png`.
