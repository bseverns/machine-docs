# Quick Start — LulzBot Mini 3

**Goal:** Achieve a clean print in ~15 minutes while learning the Cura-driven workflow.

1. Review the [safety brief](./safety.md) so you know the burn points and E-stop locations.
2. Import `calibration-cube-20mm.stl` and the `cura-5.6.0-lulzbot-mini-3-standard.curaprofile` from [`profiles/sample`](./profiles/sample/) to establish the baseline slice.
3. Follow the [SOP](./sop.md) exactly: Preflight → Operation → Postflight.
4. Log the run in the [sample run log](./logs/sample-run-log.csv) with filament color, nozzle hours, and any brim drama.
5. Record offset tweaks, wiping station changes, or nozzle swaps in the [maintenance log](./logs/maintenance-log.csv).
6. Capture jams, adhesion fails, or anything off-nominal in the [incident log](./logs/incident-log.csv) before the shift ends.
