# Preview Capture Cheat Sheet

Open the toolpath in Carbide Create 7 or your CAM of choice, flip to the simulation view, and highlight the surfacing + pocket passes. We want the spindle path, the stock block, and the tool info overlay all in frame.

Export or screenshot the view and save it here as `preview.png`. Annotate the DOC (0.5 mm) and feed (900 mm/min) if your software allows markups.

Can't swing it? Leave this placeholder, mention it in the run log, and keep the machine moving.
