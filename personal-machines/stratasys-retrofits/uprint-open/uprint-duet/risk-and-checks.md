- Sensor mapping: verify each K‑type channel reads sane ambient before enabling heaters.
- Chamber SSR: choose properly rated devices; verify switching on low setpoints.
- Fans: ensure continuous airflow at high chamber temps to protect wiring and belts.
- Use RRF macros for safe startup/shutdown; test E‑stop behavior.
