# BOM — uPrint on Marlin

Pick a controller you’re comfortable with (SKR 1.4 or Octopus are good defaults). Use either **thermocouple amplifier boards** to keep K‑type sensors or replace with **PT100/1000/NTC** parts for simpler wiring.

See `BOM.csv` for an editable table. Add vendor links as you source parts.
