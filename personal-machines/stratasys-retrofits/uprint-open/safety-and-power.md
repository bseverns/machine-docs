# Safety & Power â€” uPrint Retrofit

- Treat **mains wiring** as a separate, documented subsystem; use proper fusing and enclosures.  
- Heated chambers draw significant power; size wires and SSRs accordingly.  
- Use **ferrules** and strain reliefs; route sensor and endstop lines away from motor bundles.  
- Keep a **grounding checklist** and continuity test log.
