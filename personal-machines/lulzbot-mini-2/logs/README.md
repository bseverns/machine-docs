# Logs — LulzBot Mini 2

Use this directory as the rolling record of offsets, plate swaps, and weird print behavior. Suggested trackers:

- `z-offsets.csv` — capture date, sheet ID, nozzle, measured Z.
- `filament-swaps.csv` — document material, temp, retraction tweaks.
- `incident-journal.md` — free-form notes when something smokes, jams, or vibrates wrong.

Add the files you actually use; just keep the naming clear so the next punk rock tech can riff on your data.
