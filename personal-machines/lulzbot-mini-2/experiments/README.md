# Experiments log — LulzBot Mini 2

Drop one folder per experiment. Include:
- Slicer profile export (`.curaprofile` or `.3mf`).
- Before/after photos or microscope shots if you're chasing surface quality.
- A short README that states **goal → variables → outcome**.

Think lab notebook, but with more riffs and fewer missing settings.
