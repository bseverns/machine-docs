# Display Notes — TJC vs DWIN/DGUS (Aquila context)

- **TJC** and **DWIN/DGUS** are different smart-display ecosystems. Firmware and UI assets are **not** interchangeable.  
- ProUI releases typically include variants or guidance for **DWIN**, **DACAI**, and **TJC** screens.  
- Use the proper asset pack (`TJC_SET` vs `DWIN_SET`/`private`) and matching mainboard firmware to avoid corruption.

If the UI looks garbled after flashing, re‑flash with the correct asset pack and power‑cycle fully.
