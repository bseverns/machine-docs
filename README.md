# Fabrication Machines — Living Docs

_A practical, evolving field manual for our digital fabrication lab. Built to help people make more, better, and safer._

- **Scope:** 3D printers (MakerBot Sketch, Sketch+; MakerBot Method X; LulzBot Mini 3) and **CNC** (Genmitsu Cubiko).
- **Audience:** students, staff, and community members; new operators through advanced maintainers.
- **Status:** initial scaffold · 2025-09-19. This repo is intentionally modular and versioned. Treat it like a handbook and a lab log.

## How to Use

1. Start at your **machine folder** → read the `README.md` → follow the **SOP** and **Safety**.
2. Complete the **Operator Checklist** and **Quiz** to earn your badge.
3. When you learn something new, **submit a PR**—this is a living document.

## Contribution Rhythm

- Small fixes: open a PR with a clear diff and photos if relevant.
- New procedures: start from `/templates/SOP-template.md`.
- Incidents: record in the machine’s `/logs/incident-log.csv` within 24 hours and file an issue.

> _The lab is a chorus: each user leaves it singing more in tune than they found it._
